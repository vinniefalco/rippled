[section:serializer_streams Serializer Stream Operations]

Non-trivial algorithms need to do more than send entire messages
at once, such as:

* Send the header first, and the body later.

* Set chunk extensions or trailers using a chunk decorator.

* Send a message incrementally: bounded work in each I/O cycle.

* Use a series of caller-provided buffers to represent the body.

These tasks may be performed by using the serializer stream interfaces.
To use these interfaces, first construct a __serializer__ object with
the message to be sent. The serializer type has this declaration:

[http_snippet_9]

The choices for template types must match the message passed on construction.
This code creates an HTTP response and the corresponding serializer:

[http_snippet_10]

The function
[link beast.ref.http__make_serializer `make_serializer`]
is provided to simplify creation of variables:

[http_snippet_11]

The stream operations which work on serializers are:

[table Serializer Stream Operations
[[Name][Description]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.http__write.overload1 [*write]]
][
    Send everything in a __serializer__ to a __SyncWriteStream__.
]]
[[

]]
[[

    Send only the header from a __serializer__ to a __SyncWriteStream__.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.http__async_write_header [*async_write_header]]
][
    Send only the header from a __serializer__ asynchronously to an __AsyncWriteStream__.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.http__write_some.overload1 [*write_some]]
][
    Send part of a __serializer__ to a __SyncWriteStream__.
]]
[[
    [link beast.ref.http__async_write_some [*async_write_some]]
][
    Send part of a __serializer__ asynchronously to an __AsyncWriteStream__.
]]
]

Here is an example of using a serializer to send a message on a stream
synchronously. This performs the same operation as calling `write(stream, m)`:

[heading Chunk Decorators]

When the message used to construct the serializer indicates the chunked
transfer encoding, the serializer will automatically generate the proper
encoding in the output buffers. __rfc7230__ defines additional fields
called the
[@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.1 chunk extensions]
in chunks with body octets, and the
[@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2 chunked trailer part]
for the final chunk. Applications that wish to emit chunk extensions
and trailers may instantiate the serializer with a "chunk decorator" type,
and pass an instance of the type upon construction. This decorator is
a function object which, when invoked with a __ConstBufferSequence__,
returns a
[link beast.ref.string_view `string_view`] containing either the extensions
or the trailer. For chunks containing body data, the passed buffer will
contain one or more corresponding body octets. The decorator may use this
information as needed. For example, to compute a digest on the data and
store it as a chunk extension. For the trailers, the serializer will
invoke the decorator with a buffer sequence of size zero. Or more
specifically, with an object of type
[@http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/null_buffers.html `boost::asio::null_buffers`].

For body chunks the string returned by the decorator must follow the
[@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.1 correct syntax]
for the entire chunk extension. For the trailer, the returned string
should consist of zero or more lines ending in a CRLF and containing
a field name/value pair in the format prescribed by __rfc7230__. It
is the responsibility of the decorator to manage returned string buffers.
The implementation guarantees it will not reference previous strings
after subsequent calls.

This defines a decorator which sets an extension variable `x` equal
to the size of the chunk in bytes, and returns a single trailer field:
