[section:core Using Networking]

This library makes network primitives used by the implementation publicly
available so users can take advantage of them in their own libraries.
These primitives include traits, buffers, buffer algorithms, and helpers
for implementing asynchronous operations compatible with __Asio__ and
described in __N3747__. This section lists these facilities by group,
with descriptions.

[important
    This documentation assumes familiarity with __Asio__. Sample
    code and identifiers used throughout are written as if the
    following declarations are in effect:
