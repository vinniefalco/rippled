[section:FieldsReader FieldsReader]

A [*FieldsReader] provides a algorithm to obtain a sequence of buffers
representing the complete serialized HTTP/1 header for a set of fields.
The implementation constructs an instance of this type when needed, and
calls into it once to retrieve the buffers.

In this table:

* `X` denotes a type that meets the requirements of [*FieldsReader].

* `F` denotes a __Fields__ where
      `std::is_same<X, F::reader>::value == `true`.

* `a` is a value of type `X`.

* `f` is a value of type `F`.

* `v` is an integer representing the HTTP version.

* `c` is an integer representing the HTTP status-code.

* `m` is a value of type [link beast.ref.http__verb `verb`].

        A type which meets the requirements of __ConstBufferSequence__.
        This is the type of buffer returned by `X::get`.

        The implementatation uses this constructor to indicate
        that the fields being serialized form part of an HTTP
        request. The lifetime of `f` is guaranteed
        to end no earlier than after the `X` is destroyed.

        The implementatation uses this constructor to indicate

    [X::const_buffers_type]
    [
        Called once after construction, this function returns
        a constant buffer sequence containing the serialized
        representation of the HTTP request or response including
        the final carriage return linefeed sequence (`"\r\n"`).

        for `std::false_type`.
